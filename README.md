The place where' we'll hopefully change the world through sound. 
I'm a musician who also became a certified Qigong/Tai Chi Instructor and Healer back in 2014. Naturally, I was drawn to research on sound-based healing methods. Particularly compelling were experiments that show certain types of sound and music that have either positive or negative affects on water molecules (water making up over 70% of our own physical makeup and that of our DNA).

I'm looking for a way to analyze sounds and identify factors that make a sound "helpful" or "harmful". This data could then be used by a program to allow users to drag and drop their favorite song and receive some kind of rating to determine if the song is physically therapeutic or harmful.
